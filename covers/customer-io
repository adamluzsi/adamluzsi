Hello Julia,

I am excited to submit my application for the Senior Back-End Engineer position at Customer.io. 
With over a decade of practical experience in back-end development, I've gained a deep understanding of this field that I'm keen to bring to your team.

My experience at various companies has given me the opportunity to work on developing high-volume applications and fine-tuning performance. 
I've grown comfortable with various programming languages including Go with 6+ years of experience and I've tackled numerous cloud computing challenges.

Agile methodologies are my preferred approaches for project management, and test-driven design is my choice for producing maintainable software.
These methods have allowed me to stay flexible, maintain high quality standards, and ensure smooth communication within my team in a rapidly changing environment.
Customer.io's focus on customer-centric solutions resonates with me, as does your inclusive work culture. 
I believe my experiences and shared values would make me a fitting addition to your team.

I am grateful for your time and consideration and would love to discuss further how I can contribute to Customer.io.

Kind regards,
Adam Luzsi
