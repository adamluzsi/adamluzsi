-----------------------

My proudest accomplishment is the advancements I made in my personal research regarding the correlation between human cognitive constraints and how various design paradigms influence this, as well as the capability to upkeep and expand a system's features.

The results of this research were manifested in an open-source initiative, which can be viewed here:

While having the answers from the start could have led to a more streamlined process, avoiding the need for numerous prototypes, the real value lay in the journey of discovery. :)

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am deeply intrigued by the opportunity to join Qonto. As I understand it, the company culture and ethos align closely with my perception of an ideal work environment where the principles of a growth mindset are truly embodied.

Throughout my career in software development, I've engaged with various domains and programming languages. My top picks, Go and Ruby, are among Qonto's favoured languages, which excites me. However, my zest for learning is not limited to these alone. I eagerly venture outside my comfort zone to discover new knowledge and skills, always ready to broaden my horizons.

Regarding culture, I deeply appreciate teamwork, especially stable team setups, which align with Qonto's philosophy. I am often proactive in extending my knowledge beyond my immediate team through lightning talks and mentoring, although I am more than willing to adapt to Qonto's knowledge-sharing approach.

Mentoring holds a special place in my professional journey. I find great fulfilment in guiding and supporting individuals, both during and outside my work, fostering their professional and personal growth. This exchange of knowledge and experiences has been among the most rewarding aspects of my career.

Thank you for considering my application. A company rarely excites me as Qonto does. The work methods and ethos answer a call I have long longed for.

Best Regards,
Adam Luzsi
