Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Platform Engineer position at Super Evil Megacorp. As a seasoned IT professional with a passion for gaming, I bring a wealth of experience in backend engineering, having worked extensively with Golang, Ruby, JavaScript, and C#.

My career has been marked by designing highly scalable, distributed systems and managing data warehouses, notably during my tenure with the Historical Data Service team. Recently, I've started to dabble in Unity3D as a hobby, focusing on its Data-oriented tech stack. My dream is to become an indie developer, but my strength lies in server-side programming.

I admire Super Evil Megacorp's commitment to creating shared gaming experiences for players and am eager to contribute to a team that values player feedback. I am also impressed by your company's embrace of a fully remote environment and flexible schedules, which aligns with my own belief in the importance of work-life balance.

I am excited about the possibility of contributing to Super Evil Megacorp's mission to create deeply engaging and technically outstanding games. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your needs for the Senior Platform Engineer position.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Adam Luzsi
