Dear Open Systems / Mr. Blecher,

I hope you're doing well. My name is Adam Luzsi, a software engineer.
The idea of potentially joining your team as a Site Reliability Engineer fills me with joy,
as I have a soft spot for the 12 factor principles and software architecture,
so I'm eager to explore this possibility with you.

I've spent the last few years immersed in the world of DevOps, security, test automation, and software architecture.
I've had the privilege of being involved in designing scalable software solutions and it has been an enlightening journey.
I have never worked as a SRE, but as part of the DevOps culture, I actively cooperated with system engineers,
and deepened by experty to make applications which as joy to maintain for both parties.
I've come to realize the enormous potential for growth and contribution that comes with dedication and a genuine zest for learning.
Thus I would love to deepen my knowledge with Site Reliability Engineering. 

The vision of Open Systems resonated with me, and I am impressed by the idea that each team member contributes to making this vision a reality.
Your team sounds like a great place where I could both share what I've learned and continue to broaden my skills.

I'd be genuinely grateful for an opportunity to chat more about how my experiences might align with what you're looking for at Open Systems.
Thanks so much for considering my application.

Wishing you a great day,
Adam Luzsi
