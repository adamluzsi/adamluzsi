Dear Hiring Manager at GitLab,

I am Adam Luzsi, a software engineer with an inherent passion for automated testing. I am thrilled to submit my application for the Senior Software Engineer in Test role at GitLab, as I have always admired your organization's commitment to ensuring that everyone's voice is heard and can contribute.

My professional journey has always been shaped by a deep-seated passion for testing. My enthusiasm led me to create 'testcase', a testing framework designed to encourage a classicist Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach among Go developers. This project, born from my commitment to quality assurance, perfectly showcases my ability to innovate testing processes and my dedication to sharing knowledge with others.

In addition to my work on 'testcase', I have consistently integrated a 'test-first' approach in all my roles, making testing an integral part of the development process from the earliest stages. This approach has proven instrumental in improving overall code quality and system reliability.

Beyond my hands-on work, I am active in the testing community. Through the Gopher Slack's testing channel, I provide advice and support to other professionals, which not only solidifies my understanding but also allows me to contribute to the growth of others in the field.

My extensive experience in Ruby and Go, combined with a deep understanding of Git and infrastructure tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and Ansible, equips me with the necessary skills to excel in this role. I am particularly captivated by GitLab's dedication to embedding quality into all stages of development and its emphasis on fast feedback and test parallelization.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to explore how my passion for testing and my ability to design effective testing strategies can enhance the software delivery process at GitLab.

Best regards,
Adam Luzsi
