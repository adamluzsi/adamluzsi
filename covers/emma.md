Dear Emma Team,

When my wife noticed that I was considering applying to Emma, her eyes sparkled. 
She shared that everyone she knew who bought an Emma mattress loved it and was super satisfied. 
To me, that speaks volumes about customer satisfaction, and it ignited my desire to be a part of a team that brings joy and comfort to so many lives.

With a background in designing APIs, backend services, 
and working with various databases in a cloud environment like AWS, 
I'm excited by the opportunity to contribute my skills to a company that's not only innovative but beloved by its customers.

I share Emma's passion for creativity, teamwork, and a drive to disrupt the traditional sleep industry. 
The prospect of being able to architect and design solutions 
that can improve people's sleep is not only professionally exciting but personally fulfilling.

What draws me to Emma isn't just the tech or even the rave reviews from customers like those my wife knows. 
It's also the culture. Your focus on growth, team building, and inclusivity resonates with me. 
I'm eager to become an "Emmie" and contribute my energy to create something impactful,
enhancing the same customer satisfaction that so impressed my wife.

Thank you for considering me for this role. 
I'm excited about the possibility of joining the Emma family and helping to shape the future of sleep technology.

Warm regards,
Adam Luzsi
