Dear Phill Bateman / Hiring Manager,

I hope this letter finds you well. My friend, Daniel Nagy, recommended that I reach out to you about the Senior Software
Engineer position at British Petroleum (BP). He speaks highly of BP's culture and commitment to innovation, which
resonates with me.

I'm a Software Engineer with a knack for backend development, having worked across various industries. I'm comfortable
with languages like Go, Ruby, JavaScript, and C#, and I have a soft spot for designing maintainable software solutions
and also to make open-source contributions.
I've had the chance to work on enhancing payment systems, improving user experiences,
and integrating new payment options in my previous roles.

I'm also active in the open-source community, contributing to projects and sharing knowledge. I believe
in the power of collaboration and continuous learning.

BP's dedication to sustainability is inspiring. I'm excited about contributing to BP's digital transformation journey and sustainability goals. I look forward to working with a diverse and global team.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm excited about the possibility of contributing to BP and learning from the
team.

Best,
Adam Luzsi
