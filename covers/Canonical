Dear Hiring Manager at Canonical,

I'm excited to apply for the Software Engineer position, as my admiration for Canonical and its mission to make Linux accessible has greatly influenced my career. It was through Ubuntu, your flagship product, that I developed a deep appreciation for GNU+Linux-based systems.

My skills align well with the role's requirements. I have extensive experience in Go programming and have deployed applications to Ubuntu servers. 
While not detailed in my CV, my proficiency in shell scripting has proved beneficial across various contexts.

I'm eager to contribute to the mission that first piqued my interest in GNU+Linux.
I'm confident that my passion for software development and my commitment to creating accessible tools align with the values of your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to potentially discussing my qualifications further.

Best Regards,
Adam Luzsi
