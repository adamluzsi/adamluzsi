Dear Hiring Manager,

I hope this message finds you well.
I'm reaching out with great enthusiasm regarding your open position at SumUp, closely following your strides in supporting small businesses.

Currently, I'm with SaltPay, where I've honed my skills 
by developing both a payment gateway system and an acquiring registration service.
These experiences perfectly align with SumUp's domain, making me a potential asset to your diverse team.

Your commitment to small business owners resonates with me, 
as I loved hearing back SaltPay's SMB business owners, as it helped me to know,
where should I raise my concerns when it comes to product development?

I admire the inclusive and diverse culture at SumUp; this is something that I highly value,
as background should not matter, only the mindset.
This is also how I found my mentees, and thanks to that, I had the pleasure of working with various people. 

I'm particularly drawn to your 'team-first' attitude, 
something I've also cherished and was a driving force to understand the goals of agile practices.

Building upon my years of experience as a backend engineer, with a particular focus on Golang, and my familiarity with AWS, Kubernetes, SQS, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, I am confident I would be able to add value to the team.

Yet, what excites me the most about SumUp is the potential to be part of a culture, 
where sharing knowledge, especially about test-driven design techniques, is cherished,
as continuous integration & deployment are highly valued.
I hold testing as a topic dear and practice it in almost every one of my open-source projects,
I look forward to bringing this unique blend of passion and experience to your team.

I look forward to discussing this further.
Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
Adam
