Dear Hiring Manager at MessageBird,

I am writing to apply for the Senior Software Engineer (Go) position as advertised.
As an experienced software engineer with a strong foundation in Go, and a keen interest in cloud infrastructure,
I am confident that my skills and passion make me a strong candidate for this role.

The position at MessageBird is particularly appealing to me 
because of the emphasis on creating impactful products and the commitment to continuous learning and knowledge sharing.
As someone who thrives in an environment of growth and innovation, 
I believe I would fit well into your team and your corporate culture.

Throughout my career, I've developed a strong proficiency in Golang and have experience dealing with high traffic applications.
Additionally, I have extensive experience working with relational and non-relational data stores such as MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, BoltDB, Redis and more.
Having designed and developed complex applications in a distributed cloud-based system, I understand the importance of creating solutions that are scalable, fault-tolerant, and highly performant.

Moreover, I am not only focused on creating code that works, but code that works well.
I am a strong believer in the principle of "going fast by going well" - ensuring the code I write is robust, maintainable, and clean.
I believe this attitude aligns with MessageBirdâ€™s agile development approach and the commitment to delivering rigorously tested and statically analyzed applications in a highly distributed and scalable environment.

As an enthusiastic lifelong learner, I am excited about the opportunity to teach and mentor others on the team, and equally look forward to learning from the talented professionals at MessageBird.
With your diverse team across nearly 40 different locations, the opportunity for global collaboration and the cross-fertilization of ideas is truly exciting.

I am confident that my background and skills align well with MessageBird's values and mission.
I appreciate your consideration and look forward to the possibility of contributing to your dynamic team.
Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Adam Luzsi
