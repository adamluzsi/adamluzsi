Dear Reader at Monzo,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in your Senior Backend Engineer position.
As an experienced IT professional and a committed open-source contributor, I strongly resonate with Monzo's mission and values.
Working for a digital bank that puts its customers first, truly values transparency, and is deeply rooted in the principles of quality software development and continuous learning is invigorating to me.

I've built a deep reservoir of knowledge and insight with diverse experience spanning several industries, such as finance, marketing, second-hand marketplace, healthcare, and insurance.
This breadth of experience, coupled with my proficiency in programming languages including but not limited to Go (6+ years), Ruby, JavaScript, and C#, enables me to adapt and deliver efficient and maintainable software solutions in complex environments.

My approach to software design is grounded in guiding principles such as the 12-factor methodology, SOLID principles, Hexagonal architecture, and Clean Architecture.
I am a staunch advocate for maintainability and simplicity, and I have always adhered to automated testing practices, with Test-Driven Development (TDD) being a cornerstone of my work philosophy.

In the open-source community, I've had the privilege of learning from and contributing to open-source projects. I have my share of contributions with projects like frameless, testcase, toggler, and rack-app.
This habit has further underscored my belief in the power of collaboration, knowledge sharing, and continuous learning - a culture I see mirrored in Monzo.

I have gained significant experience in data management, API design, DevOps, and security throughout my career.
I have worked with various databases, API stacks, agile methodologies, and security principles, enabling me to provide robust solutions that meet diverse business and user needs.

One of the things that attracts me most to Monzo is the innovative engineering culture.
The collaborative approach, the commitment to personal growth, and the willingness to push boundaries are values I hold in high esteem.
Joining your team will provide a platform for continuous professional growth while allowing me to make valuable contributions to Monzo's success.

My passion for lifelong learning extends to mentoring.
I select mentees based on their desire to learn, irrespective of their origin, gender, race or other factors, encouraging diversity.
Some of my mentees include individuals from the USA, Azerbaijan, Hungary, Germany, Russia, France, and India.

To maximize my attention to each mentee, I mentor one individual at a time, using a tailored curriculum based on their unique needs.
This focused approach has assisted me in many successful programming journeys while continually learning and growing from these ventures.
These experiences would bring great value to a diverse, innovative organization like Monzo.

Thank you for considering my application.
I look forward to discussing how my background and skills could be a great fit for your team.

Best Regards,
Adam Luzsi
