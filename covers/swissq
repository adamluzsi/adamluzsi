Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in joining your software development team at SwissQ. My friend, Denis Kustanci, spoke highly of your organization, describing it as a workplace with a human-centric culture, continuous learning, and the freedom to discover optimal customer solutions. This approach strongly resonated with my aspirations as a software engineer and architect.

With a decade-long journey in the IT industry, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects using languages such as Go, Ruby, JavaScript, and C#. My contributions to open-source projects like Frameless, TestCase, Toggler, and Rack-App illustrate my dedication to developing flexible, maintainable systems with effective testing strategies.

I am particularly drawn to SwissQ because of your commitment to Agile methodologies, where I have gained significant experience and understanding over the years.

In addition to my technical skills, I've had the privilege of mentoring junior and mid-mid-levelneers in the open-source community. This experience has instilled in me a passion for sharing knowledge and supporting others, values I understand SwissQ profoundly appreciate.

Denis's depiction of SwissQ makes it seem an lent fit for my values, skills and career aspirations. I am thrilled at the prospect of contributing to SwissQ's mission and growing with your team.

While I possess some functional understanding of German, I humbly admit that my proficiency is limited to everyday use and not yet up to professional standards. I am eager to enhance my language skills and learn German more formally.

Thank you for considering my application. 
I look forward to discussing this further with you.

Sincerely,
Adam Luzsi
