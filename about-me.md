Hello! I'm Adam Luzsi, an IT professional with a keen interest in maintainable software development.
My skills encompass several programming languages, notably Go (6+ years), Ruby (7+ years),
but also gained experienced with C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, and a bit with Java and PHP.

I've applied these competencies across various industries such as
finance, marketing, second-hand marketplace, healthcare, and insurance, bringing effective software
solutions to complex problems.
An essential part of my career is being a dedicated open-source contributor and a lifelong learner.
Please check out my GitHub profile for more about my work and contributions.

I see myself as a Senior Software Engineer,
and some may categories similar expectations as a Principal SE or Staff SE,
I find that these titles can vary significantly in their interpretation across different companies.
Therefore, I prefer not to place too much emphasis on them.

This summary should give you a good overview of my experience and capabilities,
and the rest of the document provides more detailed information if you're interested.

## My current open-source software projects:

- [frameless | anti-framework for system flexibility and maintainability](https://github.com/adamluzsi/frameless)
- [rack-app | a minimalist ruby web framework](https://github.com/rack-app/rack-app)
- [testcase | test-driven designing a toolkit for Go to support classicist TDD testing](https://github.com/adamluzsi/testcase)
- [toggler | a self-hosted feature flag and a release management service.](https://github.com/toggler-io/toggler)


## Expertise

In software development, I've had the privilege of working with a wide range of **programming languages**,
such as **Golang** (since 2017), **Ruby** (since 2011), **C#**, **JavaScript**/**TypeScript**, **PHP** and **Java**. 
These experiences have allowed me to navigate diverse environments, 
from **backend** to **client-side**, **web development**, and **microservices**, utilising various **frameworks**.

When designing software, I meet human needs and strive for simplicity amidst complexity. I am well-versed in applying
**principles** like the **12-factor methodology**, **SOLID principles**, **Hexagonal architecture**, and **Clean
Architecture** to empower
developers and enhance maintainability while considering human cognitive constraints.

**Automated testing** is a must for me. I firmly believe in practices like **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. 
When I lacked the required tooling to achieve high-quality, modular,
and easily maintainable automated tests, I invented it myself.
Whether working on professional projects or pursuing my ones, I always apply this level of thorough testing.

Being part of the **open-source community**, I cherish the idea of mutual learning and collaboration. It's an
environment
where I learn, contribute, and actively support others, especially in testing, by sharing my knowledge and experiences.

In terms of **data management**, I have successfully handled an array of **databases**,
including **PostgreSQL** (since 2011), **MySQL**, **BoltDB**, **MongoDB**,
**Redshift**, **GreenPlum**, **Redis**, and **Kafka**,
and I have expertise in designing efficient **ETL data pipelines**.

One of my go-to choices for databases has consistently been **PostgreSQL**. 
I've been using it professionally since 2011,
including 3.5 years as a data warehouse engineer 
where I managed large datasets using **Greenplum**, a **PostgreSQL** variant.

My experience extends to **API design**, where I have worked with different stacks like
**RESTful**, **GraphQL**, **gRPC**, and **SOAP**.

As part of my ongoing learning journey, I gained comprehensive experience in fostering the growth of both team members
and independent individuals, nurturing their professional and personal advancement through **mentoring**.
Sharing knowledge and supporting others has been a rewarding aspect of my career.

**DevOps** has been a crucial part of my professional journey, involving implementing, managing, and scaling
applications.
Through this experience, I have recognised the value of cross-functional workflows between teams. I have utilised tools
such as **OpsGenie**, **PagerDuty**, and **Pingdom** for on-call duties to ensure prompt response and resolution.

Adding to my DevOps skills, I have extensive experience hosting applications on different platforms,
including **AWS Amazon Web Services**, **Google Cloud Platform**, **DigitalOcean**, and **on-premise** environments.
My proficiency extends to tools like **ArgoCD**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**, and **Ansible**,
bolstering my capabilities in orchestrating and automating deployment processes.

My understanding of **agile methodologies** has been enriched
by active involvement in practices such as **Scrum**, **XP**, and **Agile Development**.
Embracing these methodologies has enabled me to deliver high-quality software solutions collaboratively.

**Security** is an aspect of IT that I deeply respect, and I have proactively sought to enhance my application designs
through a foundational understanding of **ethical hacking**. My knowledge in this area stems from online courses and
mentorship from a **Security Expert** when I worked at **Emarsys Technologies**.

### Domain knowledge

I have also had the opportunity to showcase my leadership capabilities by leading a small team for several projects,
further honing my organisational and communication skills.

My professional journey has led me to work in diverse industries:

- In the financial sector, I gained valuable insights into payment systems, acquiring hosts, and financial regulations
  during my tenure at Teya (SaltPay).
- I leveraged technology to streamline tasks and automate marketing workflows within the marketing industry, providing
  customers with valuable insights into their revenue streams while working at Emarsys.
- Additionally, I delved into data warehousing and ETL processes as a member of their Historical Data Service team.
- During my time at People Process Technology, I had the valuable opportunity to acquire knowledge and skills in working
  with workflow engines and addressing technical requirements associated with healthcare data.
- At Tutti.ch, I contributed to enhancing a thriving second-hand marketplace, optimising user experience and
  streamlining transactions.
- At CFB Kft, I learned about the complex policy systems of the insurance sector and participated in the design of
  compliant insurance software solutions.

I am grateful for the diverse and comprehensive knowledge I have gained throughout my career. I am enthusiastic about
utilising this experience to create effective software solutions across various industries.
