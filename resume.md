## Summary

Hello! I'm Adam Luzsi, an IT professional with a keen interest in maintainable software development.
My skills encompass several programming languages, notably Go (6+ years), Ruby (7+ years),
but also gained experienced with C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, and a bit with Java and PHP.

I've applied these competencies across various industries such as
finance, marketing, second-hand marketplace, healthcare, and insurance, bringing effective software
solutions to complex problems.
An essential part of my career is being a dedicated open-source contributor and a lifelong learner.
Please check out my GitHub profile for more about my work and contributions.

I see myself as a Senior Software Engineer,
and some may categories similar expectations as a Principal SE or Staff SE,
I find that these titles can vary significantly in their interpretation across different companies.
Therefore, I prefer not to place too much emphasis on them.

This summary should give you a good overview of my experience and capabilities,
and the rest of the document provides more detailed information if you're interested.
