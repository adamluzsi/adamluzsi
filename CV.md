### Portfolio

This list contains a few projects from my experience:

### Open-Source Software - Testcase

To ensure maintainability and flexibility in my Golang projects, I incorporated key elements from various frameworks to
create a powerful and adaptable testing suite. The framework empowers the creation of modular, reusable components and
facilitates a classicist TDD testing strategy. It simplifies test setup and teardown, eliminating the need for extensive
stubs or mocks. This enhances code trustworthiness and enables the reusability of test helpers. Developers can leverage
these benefits by using the framework.

### Open-Source Software - Frameless

I have conducted extensive research on software design idioms, particularly focusing on the Hexagonal architecture's
port idiom. This allows me to provide valuable guidance on software design. As part of this project, I developed modular
and reusable consumer-driven contracts. These contracts played a crucial role in enhancing the work of my team at Teya.
They facilitated smoother collaboration and improved the overall efficiency of our development process.

### Open-Source Software - Toggler

I'm working on a feature management platform that enables companies to easily manage rollout without being tied to
expensive proprietary software. The platform is open-source and designed for scalability. We prioritize comprehensive
documentation and rigorous testing to ensure reliability and flexibility in the system's implementation. Iâ€™m actively
working on this, but as a side effect of this project, the frameless anti-framework born, along with the testcase
testing library.

### Open-Source Software - Rack-App

I developed a minimalistic framework for educational and production use. The project focused on deepening my TDD/BDD
knowledge and involved practicing heavy refactoring, which was facilitated by comprehensive tests. The framework I
developed received recognition from my peers at the current company and was successfully deployed in real-life
applications. Within the company, the project served as a demonstration of the Rack project and was utilized for the
rapid development of small HTTP web microservices.

### Emarsys - Historical Data Service

In a collaborative trio team, I played a key role in designing and building scalable solutions for storing and analyzing
big data. Our main project centered around enhancing the data warehouse through continuous improvements. We also worked
on replacing legacy solutions with more practical alternatives. We successfully enhanced the Behavior information query
service, a vital component for the company. As a result, the service's performance improved significantly, becoming
approximately 800% faster. This optimization not only made it much quicker but made room for new features building on
top of it.

### Emarsys - Escher Auth

I maintained Ruby and Golang client libraries, focusing on expanding test coverage and reducing dependencies. I
successfully resolved multiple bugs that were impacting the company's productivity. As a result, the integration time
for Ruby and Golang projects significantly decreased from a week to just mere minutes.

### Emarsys - Smart Insight

As the developer of Smart Insight, I contributed to build and maintain the data-driven solution that transforms raw data
into actionable insights.
Smart Insight uses advanced algorithms to segment customer data based on predicted behaviors, enabling targeted
marketing strategies.
It also provides real-time analysis and data visualizations for each customer segment, offering a powerful tool for
customer engagement and business growth.
The technology stack predominantly comprised Ruby as the high-level language, Rails for the web application, and
GreenPlum, a distributed big data database engine for storage.

### People Process Technology - Foton Engine

As the Lead developer, I designed and implemented a versatile solution using a workflow engine, prioritizing
maintainability, reusability, and testability. Additionally, I managed a small team responsible for the project's
backend. As a result of the implemented solution, the company achieved increased integrations between existing
microservices and gained additional government projects. These new projects required minimal UI and UX investment.
Furthermore, the workflow engine was reused to develop smaller microservices, which were orchestrated using the Foton
engine. These microservices acted as participants in the workflow engine, functioning similarly to an integration bus.

### People Process Technology - Leptop Engine

As a Lead Developer, I spearheaded the design and facilitated the implementation of an innovative internal payment
handling system, known as the Lepton Project. This system utilized a virtual currency mechanism, enabling employees to
manage and request benefits from their companies. This project showcased my ability to create effective and
user-friendly solutions that streamline internal processes and enhance employee engagement. The outcome of the Lepton
Project was a robust and efficient system that was adopted by the Hungarian Government. This system was used to manage
benefits and handle travel expenses for their employees. The successful implementation of this project demonstrated the
practicality and effectiveness of the virtual currency mechanism

, significantly streamlining the process of requesting and managing benefits. This not only improved operational
efficiency but also enhanced the experience for the government employees.

### People Process Technology - Project Healthcare Tourism

I spearheaded the development of an advanced booking engine, a pivotal solution for scheduling appointments related to
healthcare products.
Our team was committed to implementing stringent security measures in line with industry standards.
Thus, we stored all patient related data in the GT.M database in an encrypted format,
mirroring the practices of leading healthcare companies in the United States.

For the implementation of the necessary queries, we utilized the M language, renowned for its efficacy in managing
multi-dimensional databases.
The booking system's design was realized through the Ruby high-level language,
celebrated for its versatility and readability, which ensured our solution was robust and maintainable.

### Cembra Money Bank - ZEK Integration

Service owner of the ZEK integration (Zentralstelle fÃ¼r Kreditinformation) plus leading the legacy solution's
replacement project implementation. Additionally, I facilitated communication with teams involved in outsourced projects
related to this system. I proactively reverse-engineered and fixed the code, enabling the replacement of the legacy
system. This improved efficiency, received continuous awards from management, and eliminated daily incidents. The
project's successful transition freed the bank from the burdens of the legacy application.

### Tutti / Tamedia - Extending Payment System in the Blocket Platform

I analyzed and reverse-engineered the payment flows in the company's complex legacy system, which was rarely approached
by others. Additionally, I extended it by adding a new payment option. Through my efforts, I identified and resolved
hidden issues within the payment system, resulting in a modest increase in average revenue. Furthermore, I successfully
integrated TWINT into the legacy system, which surprisingly led to a substantial boost in revenue. Users showed a strong
preference for this new payment option over others.

### Tutti / Tamedia - TX Advertisement Integrations

My role was to fix the legacy integration solution that lacked tests and any form of maintainability. The mother company
was changing its approach to advertisements, so the tracking integrations had to be revisited to give more power to the
Marketing Agents. The final outcome allowed easy maintenance and the field agents could use advanced targeting to find
the right customers for better lead generation.

### VeryCreatives - 3rd party data collecting integrations with ETL 

I had the opportunity to work on a project involving the development of an API for 3rd party integrations.
The focus of the API was on importing and processing substantial data volumes.
As part of the solution, I designed a modular ETL pipeline,
that can handle different extraction and transformations, to load the data into a unified data source.

### VeryCreatives - Coaching Agile Practices (XP) and teaching about TDD 

I guided their teams on Extreme Programming (XP) and introduced some of the Test-Driven Development (TDD) techniques.
My expertise helped enhance their software development process, emphasizing quality and customer-centric solutions.

### CFB Kft - Insurance Agent Knowledge base helper
